# Credit-card-default
 Built a random forest to predict whether a given customer defaults or not.
Random forest takes a sample of features while splitting each node of its component trees. You can control the number of features considered at each split by specifying the max_features hyperparameter.
To summarise, the max_features hyperparameter is a very important one while tuning a random forest, and as you will see in the next lecture, it can affect the results of the model significantly.
